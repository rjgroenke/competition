# Competitions

### Welcome to the bitDubai software competitions!

Every year we organize software competitions in order to promote the Fermat project. We started in 2015 by selecting the core development team from among the best JAVA programmers that signed up. We spent a great summer in Budapest programming the core of Fermat.
